## About me 

I'm in the process of completing an MS in Epidemiology at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. 
During my time as an undergraduate at Thomas Jefferson University, I spent a lot of time on a project that studied the cell viability of MCF-7 cells, a breast cancer cell line, after being treated with gingerol derivatives. This project was my introduction to research and I loved every bit of it! I spent most of my time conducting cell viability assays and PCR.  
I became more interested in infectious diseases after taking microbiology and immunology courses, and from there I decided to pursue an MS in Epidemiology. I'm primarily interested in infectious disease epidemiology, with a focus on emerging infectious diseases like Nipah virus, coronaviruses, Ebola virus disease, and more!
