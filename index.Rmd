Some cool and interesting things about me, Wynter  

# A brief introduction

My name is Wynter Henry, I'm 22 years old and I'm currently a MS in Epidemiology candidate at Columbia Univeristy Mailman School of Public Health. I grew up in the South Jersey area, and went to college in Phialdelphia at Thomas Jefferson University, where I got my B.S. in Biology with a minor in Public Health Analytics. My goals post-graduation are to get some work experience and apply to some epidemiology PhD programs.
